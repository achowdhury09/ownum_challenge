# Ownum Challenge
Here's the entire project for the challenge!
**IMPORTANT**:Once the project is downloaded open the project in the IntelliJ IDE and build the project to make sure it works with your computer.
If the project is not built, the project will throw a nullPointerException because the project depends on a file (passage.txt) which will have a different absolute classpath on your computer.
* To build the project you can click the green hammer icon at the top of the toolbar, press command + F9 (if on MacOS), or navigate to the Build > Build Project option at the top of your screen.
* Once the project is built, you can either run the program through IntelliJ or via the command line.
* If run through IntelliJ, simply click the green arrow on the left side of the program and it will output the results at the bottom of your screen.
* If run through the command line, go to the out/production/ownum_challenge (i.e. "cd out/production/ownum_challenge" on macOS) folder and run the following command: "java com.company.Main".
Once you run the code the correct output should be available on the console.
